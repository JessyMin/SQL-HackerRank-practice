아직도 풀이 과정에서 아래 에러를 종종 맞닥뜨린다.

ERROR 1055 (42000) at line 1: Expression #1 of SELECT list is not in GROUP BY
clause and contains nonaggregated column 'm.id' which is not functionally
dependent on columns in GROUP BY clause; this is incompatible with sql_mode=only_full_group_by

자동으로 full_group_by될 때 nonaggregated column을 섞어서 SELECT하는 습관을 고쳐야 한다.

age 대신 code를 맵핑키로 사용해야 하는 거였다.
